      "about": "Grew Up... on Long Island, N.Y., in an extremely competitive household, thanks to his little sister Monica. Thanksgiving still brings haunting memories of the annual Geller Cup, the trophy for winning the family’s sometimes brutal touch football game. Even more haunting are Ross’ nightmares of a then-overweight Monica eating him alive.",

      "about": "Living… with her longtime best friend Monica, a move that will hopefully not spell the end of their friendship. Monica’s anal-retentive tendencies are legendary. Monica does not see them as something to be shared but rather something to be enforced, militantly.",

      "about": "Grew up… on Long Island, N.Y., in the neurotic Geller household, constantly bickering with her older brother Ross. Monica’s childhood seems like a past life, in part because of her obesity throughout most of high school, which shaped her entire adolescent experience. Even though she is now thin, the oversized ghost of “old Monica” still haunts her from time to time.",

      "about": "Grew up... the only boy among seven sisters in a large Italian-American family in Queens, N.Y. His dad was a pipefitter. You had to be bold and loud to be heard in the Tribbiani family, which might have inspired Joey to be an actor.",
